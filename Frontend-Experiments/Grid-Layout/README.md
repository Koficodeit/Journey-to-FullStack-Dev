# My First Webpage Layout Using Grid


## Overview
  This repository documents my learning journey in web development, specifically focusing on layout techniques using CSS. It includes projects built using the float, and focusing on grid properties to create various webpage layouts. Each section demonstrates the evolution of my skills, from basic multi-column layouts designs.


## Technologies Used
1. HTML5: Structuring content with semantic markup.
2. CSS3: Applying styles (with a focus on layout techniques).


## Project Highlights

   *Grid Layout Project:*

Building on floats and flexbox, this project introduces **CSS Grid**, a versatile layout system that provides greater control for designing complex web page structures. With Grid, I could create dynamic, responsive layouts using explicit rows and columns, overcoming the limitations of floats and the one-dimensional nature of Flexbox.

<Highlights:>

1. Built a webpage layout using the CSS grid property.
2. Created grid-based layouts with rows and columns, without the need for floats or positioning hacks.
3. Utilized features like grid templates, gap properties, and grid area for flexible designs.


## What I Learned

 *Float  Property:* 
0. How to create multi-column layouts, clear floats, and the challenges of using floats for complex designs.

 *Flexbox  Property:* 
0. How to manage flexible layouts, align content, and create responsive designs with ease.

 *Grid  Property:* 
0. How to design complex grid-based layouts, align content, and create both static and responsive designs using grids.



## Next Steps
1. Continue building projects using a combination of flexbox and grid for more advanced and responsive designs.
2. Focus on media queries and responsive design techniques to create fully adaptable web pages.
3. Explore CSS animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
4. Write clean, structured, and maintainable code, keeping accessibility in mind.
